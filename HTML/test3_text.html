<h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are <a href="#nowhere">marine molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida.
    They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.
    Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

<p>
    Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers,
    with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in),
    with the largest species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

    Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish.
    Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish.
    The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish
    to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4]
    Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]
